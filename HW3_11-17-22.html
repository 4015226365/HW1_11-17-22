          <br />
          Although these restrictions sound severe, the Bernoulli equation is
          very useful,<br />
          partly because it is very simple to use and partly because it can give
          great insight into the balance between pressure, velocity and
          elevation<br />
          <h2>Pressure/velocity variation</h2>
          <br />
          Consider the steady, flow of a constant density fluid in a converging
          duct, without losses due to friction (figure 14).<br />
          The flow therefore satisfies all the restrictions governing the use of
          Bernoulli's equation. Upstream and downstream of the <br />contraction
          we make the one-dimensional assumption that the velocity is constant
          over the inlet and outlet areas and <br />

          These two observations provide an intuitive guide for analyzing fluid
          flows, even when the flow is not one-dimensional.<br />
          For example, when fluid passes over a solid body, the streamlines get
          closer together, the flow velocity increases, and the pressure
          decreases. Airfoils are designed so that the flow over the top surface
          is faster than over the bottom surface,<br />
          and therefore the average pressure over the top surface is less than
          the average pressure over the bottom surface, and a resultant force
          due to this pressure difference is produced. <br />This is the source
          of lift on an airfoil. Lift is defined as the force acting on an
          airfoil due to its motion, in a direction normal to the direction of
          motion.<br />
          Likewise, drag on an airfoil is defined as the force acting on an
          airfoil due to its motion, along the direction of motion. An easy
          demonstration of the lift produced by an airstream requires a piece of
          notebook paper and two books of about equal thickness. Place the books
          four to five inches apart, and cover the gap with the paper.<br />
          When you blow through the passage made by the books and the paper,
          what do you see? Why?<br />

          Two more examples<br />
          Example 1<br />
          A table tennis ball placed in a vertical air jet becomes suspended in
          the jet, and it is very stable to small perturbations in any
          direction. Push the ball down, and it springs back to its equilibrium
          position; push it sideways, and it rapidly returns to its original
          position in the center of the jet. In the vertical direction, the
          weight of the ball is balanced by a force due to pressure differences:
          the pressure over the rear half of the sphere is lower than over the
          front half because of losses that occur in the wake (large eddies form
          in the wake that dissipate a lot of flow energy). To understand the
          balance of forces in the horizontal direction, you need to know that
          the jet has its maximum velocity in the center, and the velocity of
          the jet decreases towards its edges. The ball position is stable
          because if the ball moves sideways, its outer side moves into a region
          of lower velocity and higher pressure, whereas its inner side moves
          closer to the center where the velocity is higher and the pressure is
          lower. The differences in pressure tend to move the ball back towards
          the center.<br />
          Example 3<br />
          Suppose a ball is spinning clockwise as it travels through the air
          from left to right The forces acting on the spinning ball would be the
          same if it was placed in a stream of air moving from right to left, as
          shown in figure 15.<br />

          A thin layer of air (a boundary layer) is forced to spin with the ball
          because of viscous friction. At A the motion due to spin is opposite
          to that of the air stream, and therefore near A there is a region of
          low velocity where the pressure is close to atmospheric. At B, the
          direction of motion of the boundary layer is the same as that of the
          external air stream, and since the velocities add, the pressure in
          this region is below atmospheric. The ball experiences a force acting
          from A to B, causing its path to curve. If the spin was
          counterclockwise, the path would have the opposite curvature. The
          appearance of a side force on a spinning sphere or cylinder is called
          the Magnus effect, and it well known to all participants in ball
          sports, especially baseball, cricket and tennis players. Stagnation
          pressure and dynamic pressure Bernoulli's equation leads to some
          interesting conclusions regarding the variation of pressure along a
          streamline. Consider a steady flow impinging on a perpendicular plate
          (figure 16).<br />
          There is one streamline that divides the flow in half: above this
          streamline all the flow goes over the plate, and below this streamline
          all the flow goes under the plate. Along this dividing streamline, the
          fluid moves towards the plate. Since the flow cannot pass through the
          plate, the fluid must come to rest at the point where it meets the
          plate. In other words, it ``stagnates.'' The fluid along the dividing,
          or ``stagnation streamline'' slows down and eventually comes to rest
          without deflection at the stagnation point. Bernoulli's equation along
          the stagnation streamline gives where the point e is far upstream and
          point 0 is at the stagnation point. Since the velocity at the
          stagnation point is zero, The stagnation or total pressure, p_0, is
          the pressure measured at the point where the fluid comes to rest. It
          is the highest pressure found anywhere in the flowfield, and it occurs
          at the stagnation point. It is the sum of the static pressure (p_0),
          and the dynamic pressure measured far upstream. It is called the
          dynamic pressure because it arises from the motion of the fluid. The
          dynamic pressure is not really a pressure at all: it is simply a
          convenient name for the quantity (half the density times the velocity
          squared), which represents the decrease in the pressure due to the
          velocity of the fluid. We can also express the pressure anywhere in
          the flow in the form of a non-dimensional pressure coefficient C_p,
          where At the stagnation point C_p = 1, which is its maximum value. In
          the freestream, far from the plate, C_p = 0. Pitot tube One of the
          most immediate applications of Bernoulli's equation is in the
          measurement of velocity with a Pitot-tube. The Pitot tube (named after
          the French scientist Pitot) is one of the simplest and most useful
          instruments ever devised. It simply consists of a tube bent at right
          angles (figure 17). Figure 17. Pitot tube in a wind tunnel. By
          pointing the tube directly upstream into the flow and measuring the
          difference between the pressure sensed by the Pitot tube and the
          pressure of the surrounding air flow, it can give a very accurate
          measure of the velocity. In fact, it is probably the most accurate
          method available for measuring flow velocity on a routine basis, and
          accuracies better than 1% are easily possible. Bernoulli's equation
          along the streamline that begins far upstream of the tube and comes to
          rest in the mouth of the Pitot tube shows the Pitot tube measures the
          stagnation pressure in the flow. Therefore, to find the velocity V_e,
          we need to know the density of air, and the pressure difference (p_0 -
          p_e). The density can be found from standard tables if the temperature
          and the pressure are known. The pressure difference is usually found
          indirectly by using a ``static pressure tapping'' located on the wall
          of the wind tunnel, or on the surface of the model.
