          <h2>Earth Gravity vs. Moon Gravity</h2>
          The gravity present on the surface of the earth is equal to 9.8 m/s2,
          whereas the gravity of the moon <br />
          present on the lunar surface is only 1.63 m/s2. The earth gravity is
          very precisely mapped, while the moon <br />
          is very poorly mapped. The earth gravity is strong enough to sustain
          and withstand an atmosphere<br />
          on the earth; on the other hand, there is no atmosphere present on the
          moon gravity.<br />
          Earth is bigger as compared to the moon; on the contrary, the moon is
          smaller in size as <br />compared to the earth. <br />
          Earth’s gravitational force is stronger than the moon because of the
          presence of more massive<br />
          objects in earth; on the flip side, the moon’s gravity is weaker than
          the earth due to smaller in size as compared to the earth.<br />
          Earth gravity is denoted by g; conversely, moon gravity is denot
          ............ed by gm.<br />
          <h3>What is Earth Gravity?</h3>
          Earth gravity is the total acceleration that is communicated to the
          objects because of the combined result<br />
          of gravitation and the presence of centrifugal force from the earth’s
          rotation. Earth gravity is denoted by<br />
          small g, or gravitational constant is denoted by big G. The SI unit of
          acceleration of earth gravity is<br />
          measured in meters per second square m/s2 and which is correspondent
          to newton per kilogram.<br />
          The acceleration of the gravity close to the surface of the earth is
          about 9.8m/s2. The precise and accurate <br />strength of earth
          gravity varies depending on location. The value of Standard gravity of
          earth’s surface is<br />
          9.80665 m/s2. The earth’s surface is rotating 24/7 hours, so it is not
          an inertial frame of reference.<br />
          The outward centrifugal force which is produced by earth’s rotation is
          larger at latitudes just near the equator.<br />
          The second foremost reason for the alteration in gravity present at
          different earth’s latitudes is due to earth’s equatorial
          prominence.<br />
          The gravity of earth decreases with the increase of height because
          larger height means more difference from the earth’s midpoint.<br />
          Some various factors like in water or in air, the objects practice an
          associative resistance force that decreases the superficial force of
          earth gravity.<br />
          The earth gravity is strong enough to sustain and withstand an
          atmosphere on the earth. The acceleration of earth gravity is a vector
          quantity.<br />
          The Earth’s gravitational force is stronger than the moon because of
          the presence of more massive objects in the earth.
          <h3>What is Moon Gravity?</h3>
          Due to the gravity present on the surface of the moon, its total
          acceleration is 1.62 m/s2, which is about 16.6% that is present on the
          earth’s surface.<br />
          But over the entire surface of the moon, the gravitational
          acceleration is about 0.0253 m/s2 because weight is directly depending
          upon gravitational acceleration.<br />
          All the things on the moon will only weigh 16.6% as compared to what
          they weigh on earth such if someone’s weight on earth is 200 pounds
          then on the moon, his weight will be 30 pounds.<br />
          The gravitational acceleration of the moon has been measured by
          following the radio signals released by orbiting spacecraft.<br />
          The major specialty of mon gravity is the presence of mascon which is
          the large positive gravity anomalies directly associated with some of
          the giant impact basins. <br />The moon’s gravity is weaker than the
          earth gravity due to the smaller in size as compared to the earth.<br />
          As there is no atmosphere present on the moon gravity, so there are
          fewer chances of withstanding temperature.<br />
