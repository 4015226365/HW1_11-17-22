          <h1>What Is The Difference Between Mass And Weight?</h1>
          <hr />
          Have you been confusing mass with weight? It's very easy to do when
          you're not entirely sure of how science actually defines them.<br />
          Even though they're both linked, there is a basic difference. Mass is
          a measure of the amount of matter in an object and weight is the
          amount of force that gravity has on an object.<br />
          Most of you already use these two words on an almost daily basis
          (especially if, like me, you're conscious of your weight and spend
          hours diagnosing over how much muscle mass you built during your last
          visit to the gym).<br />
          I've put together a fairly comprehensive description of each of them
          for you which, importantly, is written in layman's terms and not
          scientific babble.<br />
          <h2>What is mass?</h2>
          Mass is a scientific measure of the amount of matter an object is made
          up of. No matter where you are at given moment in time, mass is
          constant. So, whether you're walking to the shop to stock up on
          groceries or bouncing around on the moon, your mass is the same.
          Obviously, if you're on a diet that's not the answer you want to hear
          but don't panic - we'll get to the all-important definition of weight
          shortly. Some other key points about mass Mass is indestructible. As
          you've seen above, no matter where you are in the universe your mass
          will never change Mass can never be zero. What we mean by this is that
          everything in the universe has mass. If it didn't it simply wouldn't
          exist Mass is not related to gravity, centrifugal force, etc and these
          forces have no effect whatsoever on your mass Mass is commonly
          measured in pounds and ounces (for those in the US, or those who use
          the imperial system) or kilograms and grams (for those who use the
          metric system). We have converters between the two. Hopefully, the
          descriptions above have given you a good idea of what mass really is.
          Don't fall into the trap of thinking that this unit of measure is not
          important - it is. After all, without the huge mass that makes up
          planet Earth we'd have no gravity - a great way to save money on fuel
          as you can simply float to work, but not so great when you're trying
          to drink your morning espresso on your way to the office. set of
          vintage iron weights What is weight? Weight is a form of measurement
          that is dependent on gravity and, unlike mass, your weight can vary
          depending on where you are in the universe. Advertisements Weight is a
          pretty important measure not only to dieters the world over but also
          to the scientists and egg heads who design things like space shuttles
          and boats - the opposite end of the spectrum, but it's all about
          perspective. But how can weight vary whilst mass has to remain
          constant? It's fairly simple: weight is a variable i.e. it can change
          based on the amount of gravitational pull an object exerts on a body.
          Scientists have defined weight using this equation: Formula: Weight
          (W) = Mass (M) multiplied by gravitational acceleration (g). (W = mg)
          Simple, right? Some key points about weight The weight of an object
          changes based on where it is. If you've decided to visit the moon to
          test out this theory then you'll find that, in a matter of hours, you
          will have slashed your weight by two thirds (in your face, Slimming
          World!) Weight is a vector (a quantity that is fully described by both
          a magnitude and a direction) and its direction of pull is towards the
          centre of the planet you're stood on. What? Sorry, I did promise
          layman's terms: gravity, which is created by the mass of an object,
          moves towards the centre of the object and it is gravity that
          determines your, or any other object's, weight. The weight of any
          given object can go up or down depending on the amount of gravity
          acting on it. More gravity - the heavier the object. Less gravity -
          the lighter the object. Unlike mass, weight can be zero. An example of
          this is an astronaut floating in space - there's no gravity acting on
          his body and, therefore, he has no weight. Weight is commonly measured
          in Newtons. Mass and weight example - the moon In the below example,
          we've featured an astronaut on earth and on the moon. The Moon's
          gravity is much less than the Earth's gravity - approximately one
          sixth. So, a 100 kg astronaut weighs 980N on Earth. On the Moon, the
          astronaut would weigh only 162.2N. However, the astronaut's mass is
          100kg where-ever they are. Weight on Earth: 100kg x 9.8m/s2 = 980N.
          Weight on Moon: 100kg x 1.622 m/s2 = 162.2N.
          <h2>The difference between mass and weight - clarification</h2>
          Hopefully, we've cleared up any lingering doubts you may have about
          the whole mass vs weight debate - mass is a measure of the amount of
          matter in an object and weight is the amount of force that gravity has
          on an object. As you can see, it's not quite a clear cut topic, but do
          keep these points in mind and prepare to wow your friends and family
          with your newfound knowledge of the scientific arts. If you want to
          convert between different units of mass and weight, why not use the
          weight conversion tool.
